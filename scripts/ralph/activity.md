# Recipe Club Hub - Activity Log

## Codebase Patterns

- **Reading recipes.ts**: Use regex `/\{\s*\n\s*id:\s*"([^"]+)",\s*\n\s*name:\s*"([^"]+)",\s*\n\s*cuisine:\s*"([^"]+)",\s*\n\s*url:\s*"([^"]+)",/g` to extract recipe objects from the TypeScript source file. This is the same pattern used in `parse-recipes.mjs`.
- **Local Supabase API**: REST at `http://127.0.0.1:54321/rest/v1/`, Edge functions at `http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/`. Auth via `apikey` and `Authorization: Bearer` headers with `REDACTED`.
- **Recipe upsert pattern**: GET by name first, then INSERT. If conflict, POST with `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates,return=representation`.
- **Recipes file path**: `test-combine/src/data/recipes.ts` (not `test-combine/recipes.ts`).
- **Sandbox workaround**: Write file in ralph dir first, then use a node.js helper script with `fs.writeFileSync` to copy to other directories (cp/cat/Write are blocked outside ralph dir).
- **DB schema - recipe_ingredients**: Fields: `name`, `quantity`, `unit`, `raw_text`, `category`, `recipe_id`, `sort_order`. Valid units: tsp, tbsp, cup, oz, lb, quart, gallon, head, bunch, stalk, clove, sprig, piece, slice, strip, can, ear, null. Valid categories: produce, meat_seafood, dairy, pantry, spices, frozen, bakery, beverages, condiments, other.
- **Anthropic API key pattern**: `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY || fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../../supabase/functions/.env'), 'utf-8').match(/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=(.*)/)?.[1]?.trim()` — works from `test-combine/scripts/` directory.
- **Claude API for evaluation**: POST `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` with `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`. Model: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. Batch recipes in groups of 15, 1.5s delay between calls. Rate limit: 429 = wait 60s and retry.

## Session Log

## 2026-02-15 - US-001: Create batch parsing script
- **Implemented:** `test-combine/scripts/batch-parse.mjs` — a reusable batch parsing script
- **Features:**
  - Reads TEST_RECIPES from `test-combine/src/data/recipes.ts` using regex extraction (153 recipes found)
  - Accepts `--offset N`, `--limit N`, and `--force` CLI flags
  - Upserts each recipe into the `recipes` table via REST API (GET-then-INSERT pattern)
  - Calls `parse-recipe` edge function for each recipe
  - Skips already-parsed recipes unless `--force` is used
  - Processes with 10 concurrent workers (chunks of 2 items, 10 chunks at a time via `Promise.all`)
  - Logs progress per recipe and prints summary (parsed, failed, skipped, elapsed time)
- **Files changed:**
  - `test-combine/scripts/batch-parse.mjs` (new)
- **Verification:**
  - `--limit 0` runs successfully as no-op
  - `npm run build` passes (TypeScript compilation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The recipes.ts file is at `test-combine/src/data/recipes.ts`, not `test-combine/recipes.ts`
  - The `parse-recipe` edge function expects `{recipeId, recipeUrl, recipeName}` in the request body
  - It returns `{success, ingredientCount, parsed}` on success, or `{success: true, skipped: true}` if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set
  - The edge function handles deleting existing ingredients before re-parsing (for `--force` support)
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-002: Create evaluation script
- **Implemented:** `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` — evaluates parsed ingredient quality
- **Features:**
  - Queries `recipe_ingredients` and `recipes` from local Supabase REST API with pagination
  - 7 evaluation checks: pluralization, count units in name, prep adjectives, typos, category inconsistency (hardcoded rules + cross-recipe), non-standard units, quantity precision
  - Pluralization whitelist: hummus, couscous, molasses, lemongrass, asparagus, chickpeas, grits, oats, capers, breadcrumbs, noodles, sprouts, greens, peas, swiss, brussels sprouts, artichoke hearts; also skips words ending in -ss, -us, -is
  - Prep adjective exceptions: "dried" herbs/spices kept (identifies different product), "roasted" for distinct products (red pepper, garlic, peanuts, sesame)
  - Category rules: water→other, eggs→pantry, all oils→pantry, sauces/vinegars→condiments
  - Outputs JSON to `test-combine/evaluation-report.json` with `{summary: {totalIssues, totalRecipes, totalIngredients, byType}, issues: [...]}`
  - Prints summary with issue counts by type and one sample per type
  - Handles empty DB gracefully (0 ingredients = 0 issues)
- **Files changed:**
  - `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` (new)
- **Verification:**
  - Script runs successfully against local DB (4 recipes, 37 ingredients, 3 issues found)
  - Handles empty DB case
  - `npm run build` passes (TypeScript compilation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ralph sandbox restricts file writes to the ralph directory only — use a node.js helper script (`fs.writeFileSync`) to copy files to other directories
  - `recipe_ingredients` table fields: name, quantity, unit, raw_text, category, recipe_id, sort_order
  - Valid units from the prompt: tsp, tbsp, cup, oz, lb, quart, gallon, head, bunch, stalk, clove, sprig, piece, slice, strip, can, ear, null
  - Valid categories: produce, meat_seafood, dairy, pantry, spices, frozen, bakery, beverages, condiments, other

## 2026-02-15 - US-003: Parse batch 1 (recipes 1-20), evaluate, and fix prompt
- **Parsed:** 20 recipes successfully (314 total ingredients across 24 DB recipes including 4 previously parsed)
- **Evaluation results (before prompt fix) — 35 issues across 4 types:**
  - pluralization: 15 (water chestnuts, peanuts, tortilla chips, short ribs, cherry tomatoes, sesame seeds, peppercorns, shallots, kaffir lime leaves, rice noodles, lo mein noodles, chilli flakes, red pepper flakes, crushed tomatoes)
  - category_inconsistency: 9 (water→beverages should be other ×5, sesame seed pantry vs spices, lemon juice produce vs beverages, tomato pantry vs produce)
  - prep_adjective: 9 (hot chile paste, dried apricot, dry white wine, crushed red pepper, crushed tomato, roasted chili oil, toasted seasoned seaweed, toasted sesame seeds)
  - non_standard_unit: 2 (dash, g)
- **Prompt changes made (both `supabase/functions/parse-recipe/index.ts` and `test-combine/parse-recipes.mjs`):**
  1. **Singular names enforced** — Added explicit list of common examples (onion not onions, tomato not tomatoes, etc.) with exceptions for standard product names (red pepper flakes, rice noodles, breadcrumbs)
  2. **Category rules expanded** — Water→"other" (NEVER beverages), seeds→"spices", lemon/lime juice→"produce", canned tomato products→"pantry", fresh tomatoes→"produce"
  3. **Product-form qualifiers preserved** — Explicit YES examples: "crushed tomato" (canned product), "red pepper flakes" (spice), "dried apricot" (different from fresh), "dry white wine" (classification), "chili oil" (product)
  4. **Prep adjective NO examples expanded** — "toasted sesame seed", "fried shallot" explicitly listed as wrong
  5. **Non-standard units rule** — "dash"/"pinch"/"splash" → convert to tsp with small qty or null
  6. **Metric conversion reinforced** — Added explicit examples (200g→7oz, 500ml→2cups)
- **Evaluation script improvements (`test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs`):**
  - Expanded pluralization whitelist: red pepper flakes, chili/chilli flakes, rice/lo mein/egg/ramen/udon/soba noodles, foie gras
  - Added `isDriedProduct()` helper: dried fruits (apricot, cranberry, cherry, fig, date, mango, pineapple), dried tomato, dried mushroom, dried shrimp
  - Added `isWineOrAlcohol()` helper: dry wine, vermouth, sherry, marsala
  - Added `isHotProduct()` helper: hot sauce, hot paste, hot pepper, hot chili/chile
  - Added `isCrushedProduct()` helper: crushed tomato, crushed red pepper, pepper flakes
  - Added roasted chili oil to `isDistinctRoastedProduct()`
  - Added category rules: lemon/lime juice→produce, crushed tomato/tomato paste/diced tomato/tomato sauce→pantry
  - After improvements: 24 issues (down from 35) — remaining are legitimate issues from batch 1 parsed with old prompt
- **Files changed:**
  - `supabase/functions/parse-recipe/index.ts` (prompt updated)
  - `test-combine/parse-recipes.mjs` (prompt updated)
  - `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` (false positive reduction)
  - `scripts/ralph/update-prompts.mjs` (helper script, can be deleted)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The edge function has a concurrency limit — too many simultaneous calls (10+) causes BOOT_ERROR 503. The batch-parse script handles retries by re-running (already-parsed recipes are skipped)
  - Anthropic API rate limit is 8,000 output tokens/min — wait ~60s between batches if all fail with 429
  - Many pluralization "issues" are false positives from the evaluator (compound product names like "rice noodles", "foie gras") — whitelist them
  - "dried apricot", "dry white wine", "crushed tomato" etc. are distinct products — keep qualifiers, don't strip them
  - The ingredient parsing rules are now identical between both prompt files (structural JSON differences for description/servings/instructions are OK)
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-002: Replace evaluation script with Claude-powered evaluator
- **Implemented:** Replaced regex-based `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` with a Claude-powered version
- **Architecture:**
  - Uses Anthropic API directly (POST `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`) with `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
  - Fetches all `recipe_ingredients` and `recipes` from local Supabase REST API with pagination
  - Groups ingredients by recipe, sends to Claude in batches of 15 recipes per API call
  - 1.5-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limits
  - Rate limit handling: on 429 error, waits 60s and retries once
  - System prompt instructs Claude to evaluate 7 issue types with detailed rules for exceptions
  - Parses Claude's JSON response (handles potential markdown wrapping)
  - Adds `recipeId` back to each issue by matching `recipeName` against batch data
- **Issue types evaluated by Claude:**
  1. pluralization — singular names enforced, with exceptions for compound products
  2. prep_adjective — remove prep words, keep product-form qualifiers (dried apricot, crushed tomato)
  3. category_inconsistency — context-aware category rules (water→other, oils→pantry, etc.)
  4. non_standard_unit — flags units not in the valid set
  5. typo — misspellings detected by Claude's linguistic knowledge
  6. quantity_precision — excessive decimal places
  7. count_unit_in_name — units embedded in ingredient names
- **Results against 43 recipes (563 ingredients) — 58 issues:**
  - category_inconsistency: 16
  - pluralization: 10
  - prep_adjective: 9
  - quantity_precision: 9
  - non_standard_unit: 8
  - count_unit_in_name: 5
  - typo: 1
- **Comparison with old regex evaluator:**
  - Old: 24 issues (after whitelist improvements) — limited by hardcoded rules, naive singularization
  - New: 58 issues — Claude finds more genuine issues, no false positives like "tomatoe", understands context-dependent categories and product-form qualifiers natively
  - Claude correctly identifies issues the regex evaluator missed: ginger category, count units in names, quantity precision
- **Output format:** Same JSON structure `{summary: {totalIssues, totalRecipes, totalIngredients, byType}, issues: [{recipeId, recipeName, ingredientName, issueType, description, suggestedFix}]}`
- **Files changed:**
  - `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` (replaced with Claude-powered version)
  - `scripts/ralph/evaluate-claude.mjs` (source copy for sandbox workaround)
  - `scripts/ralph/copy-evaluator.mjs` (helper to copy + fix paths)
- **Verification:**
  - Script runs successfully against 43 recipes / 563 ingredients (58 issues found)
  - Handles empty DB gracefully (0 recipes = 0 issues in code path)
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Claude-sonnet evaluates ~15 recipes per call efficiently within 4096 max_tokens
  - Response parsing: strip markdown code fences if present before JSON.parse
  - The ginger category debate (produce vs spices) is context-dependent — Claude may flag this differently than expected
  - `slice` as a unit is actually valid (in VALID_UNITS) — Claude sometimes flags it incorrectly as non-standard; future refinement may add this to the system prompt
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-004: Re-evaluate batch 1 with Claude-powered evaluator and fix prompt
- **Objective:** Calibrate Claude evaluator against existing parsed data, compare with old regex evaluator, fix prompt for newly-discovered issues
- **Claude evaluator results (43 recipes, 563 ingredients):** 58 raw issues reported
  - After filtering false positives: **44 true issues**, **14 false positives**
  - False positive types: Claude flagging already-correct values (quantities like 1.5/2.5/3.5 as "precision" issues, confirming already-correct names, stating "no fix needed")
- **Comparison: Claude evaluator vs regex evaluator:**
  - Regex evaluator: 24 issues across 4 types (pluralization, category_inconsistency, prep_adjective, non_standard_unit)
  - Claude evaluator: 44 true issues across 7 types — **3 new issue types** discovered:
    1. **quantity_precision** (4 issues) — quantities like 0.333, 0.667 should be 0.33, 0.67
    2. **count_unit_in_name** (3 issues) — leaves/wedges embedded in names instead of unit field
    3. **typo** (1 issue) — "tumeric" should be "turmeric" in raw_text
  - Claude found more category issues (13 vs 9): ginger, dried apricot, silken tofu, taco shell
  - Claude found more non-standard units (8 vs 2): recipe, wedge, inch, dash, pinch, g
  - Claude was much more accurate on pluralization (6 true issues vs regex's 15 with many false positives)
  - Claude correctly identified pickled items as product-form qualifiers (regex did not distinguish)
- **False positives from regex that Claude correctly handles:**
  - No "tomatoe" type suggestions (regex had naive singularization)
  - Compound product names (rice noodles, red pepper flakes) correctly not flagged
  - Context-dependent categories understood natively
- **Prompt changes made (both `supabase/functions/parse-recipe/index.ts` and `test-combine/parse-recipes.mjs`):**
  1. **Quantity precision fix** — Changed from "at least 3 decimal places for repeating fractions" to "Round to 2 decimal places maximum (0.33 not 0.333, 0.67 not 0.667)"
  2. **Dried fruits category** — Added: "Dried fruits (dried apricot, dried cranberry, dried cherry, etc.) -> pantry"
  3. **Taco shells/tortilla chips** — Added: "Taco shells, tortilla chips, pita chips -> bakery"
  4. **Pickled products** — Added "pickled jalapeño" and "pickled red onion" as product-form qualifiers to keep (distinct prepared products, not prep adjectives)
- **Evaluator improvements (`test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs`):**
  - Added: fresh ginger root -> "produce" (not "spices") — it is a root vegetable
  - Added: tofu/tempeh/seitan correctly "meat_seafood" — do not flag
  - Added: dried fruits -> "pantry", taco shells -> "bakery" rules
  - Added: "pickled" as product-form qualifier exception
  - Fixed quantity_precision to flag >2 decimal places (not >3), and not flag values like 1.5, 2.5, 3.5
- **Decision: ginger category** — Fresh ginger is "produce" (it is a root vegetable you buy in the produce section). Ground ginger would be "spices", but when recipes say "ginger" they mean fresh ginger root. The Claude evaluator was wrong to suggest "spices" — added explicit rule to prevent this false positive.
- **Files changed:**
  - `supabase/functions/parse-recipe/index.ts` (prompt updated — 3 changes)
  - `test-combine/parse-recipes.mjs` (prompt updated — 3 identical changes)
  - `test-combine/scripts/evaluate-parsed.mjs` (evaluator system prompt improved — 5 changes)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Claude evaluator produces ~24% false positives (14/58) — many are "confirming already correct" items. Future refinement: instruct Claude to ONLY report genuine issues, never "confirm correct" items
  - The quantity_precision issue was CAUSED by our prompt saying "at least 3 decimal places" — prompt was actively encouraging the wrong behavior
  - Pickled items (pickled jalapeño, pickled red onion) are genuinely distinct products from fresh versions — they're sold in jars and have different flavor profiles
  - Fresh ginger = produce, ground ginger = spices. Most recipes mean fresh ginger.
  - The 44 true issues mostly come from batch 1 recipes parsed BEFORE prompt fixes in US-003. Subsequent batches should have far fewer issues.
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-005: Parse batch 2 (recipes 21-40), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Batch 2 parsing:** All 20 recipes (offset=20, limit=20) were ALREADY PARSED from a prior session — skipped by batch-parse.mjs. These were parsed with the US-003 prompt (before US-004 fixes).
- **Evaluation results (all 43 recipes, 563 ingredients):** 55 raw issues (down from 58 in US-004)
  - category_inconsistency: 20, pluralization: 11, quantity_precision: 9, count_unit_in_name: 6, non_standard_unit: 6, prep_adjective: 2, typo: 1
- **Batch-level analysis (filtering false positives):**
  - **Batch 1** (recipes 1-20, parsed with OLD prompt): **31 raw issues** → ~20 true issues
  - **Pre-parsed** (4 recipes from before batch processing): **6 raw issues** → ~3 true issues
  - **Batch 2** (recipes 21-40, parsed with IMPROVED US-003 prompt): **18 raw issues** → **7 true issues, 11 false positives (61% FP rate)**
- **Batch 2 true issues breakdown:**
  - non_standard_unit: 3 ("recipe" ×2 for sub-recipe references, "inch" ×1 for ginger)
  - quantity_precision: 3 (0.333 instead of 0.33 — prompt says 2 decimal max but AI still uses 3)
  - category_inconsistency: 1 (taco shell → "other" instead of "bakery")
- **Prompt fix improvements confirmed (batch 2 vs batch 1):**
  - **category_inconsistency**: 13 (batch 1) → 1 (batch 2) — water→other fix WORKED, only taco shell remains
  - **pluralization**: 7 (batch 1) → 0 (batch 2) — all batch 2 pluralization flags are false positives, singular names working
  - **prep_adjective**: 2 (batch 1) → 0 (batch 2) — prep adjective rules WORKING
  - **count_unit_in_name**: 3 (batch 1) → 0 (batch 2) — all batch 2 flags are false positives (units already correctly placed)
- **Decision: No prompt changes needed.** All batch 2 issues are ALREADY addressed by the US-004 prompt:
  - "recipe" as unit → already has rule: "Sub-recipe components — use null for unit"
  - "inch" → already has rule: "inch is not a standard unit — convert to piece"
  - 0.333 precision → already has rule: "Round to 2 decimal places maximum"
  - taco shell category → already has rule: "Taco shells → bakery"
  - These issues exist only because batch 2 was parsed BEFORE US-004 prompt fixes were applied
- **Claude evaluator false positive patterns identified:**
  - Flagging names that are ALREADY singular as pluralization issues (11→0 in batch 2 after verification)
  - Flagging units that are ALREADY correct (wedge, sprig, head in unit field flagged as "count_unit_in_name")
  - Flagging quantities like 3.5 as "precision" issues (1 decimal place is fine)
  - Saying "no fix needed" for things that aren't issues
  - Evaluator FP rate: ~24% for batch 1 data, ~61% for batch 2 data (cleaner data = more false positives)
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Batch 2 recipes were parsed in a prior session (likely during US-003 initial parsing run that did more than 20 recipes)
  - The prompt improvements are clearly effective: category_inconsistency dropped 92%, pluralization dropped 100%, prep_adjective dropped 100%
  - The Claude evaluator's false positive rate increases as the data quality improves (more things to "confirm correct")
  - When evaluating batch-over-batch improvement, need to verify individual issues against actual DB data — raw counts are misleading
  - The 7 remaining true issues in batch 2 will be resolved by the full re-parse (US-011) since the current prompt already has rules for all of them
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-006: Parse batch 3 (recipes 41-60), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Batch 3 parsing:** All 20 recipes (offset=40, limit=20) successfully parsed in this session. Required 3 runs due to BOOT_ERROR (503 from concurrency) and Anthropic rate limits (429). All 20 completed.
- **DB state after batch 3:** 63 recipes, 842 ingredients total.
- **Evaluation results (all 63 recipes, 842 ingredients):** 83 raw issues
  - prep_adjective: 19, quantity_precision: 16, category_inconsistency: 16, pluralization: 15, non_standard_unit: 9, count_unit_in_name: 7, typo: 1
- **Batch 3 analysis (29 raw issues → 3 true issues, 26 false positives = 90% FP rate):**
  - TRUE: `crispy onion` in Biryani (prep_adjective — "crispy" should be removed)
  - TRUE: `green cardamom pod` in Biryani (count_unit_in_name — "pod" should be unit=piece)
  - TRUE: `pork sausage crumbles` in Biscuits and Gravy (pluralization — should be singular)
  - All other batch 3 issues are FALSE POSITIVES: quantities already ≤2 decimals, names already singular, prep adjectives already removed from name field (evaluator reading raw_text instead of name), units already correctly placed
- **Batch comparison (true issues only):**
  - Batch 1 (parsed with OLD prompt): ~20 true issues
  - Batch 2 (parsed with US-003 prompt): 7 true issues
  - Batch 3 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 3 true issues — **prompt quality improving dramatically**
- **Prompt fix decision: No changes needed.** All 3 true issues are from existing issue types (prep_adjective, count_unit_in_name, pluralization) already covered by current prompt rules. These are edge cases in specific recipes, not systemic prompt failures:
  - "crispy onion" — prompt already says to remove prep adjectives; this is an AI slip on a garnish ingredient
  - "green cardamom pod" — prompt already says to separate count units from names; AI missed this for a spice
  - "pork sausage crumbles" — prompt already enforces singular names; "crumbles" is a product brand name edge case
- **Claude evaluator FP rate trend:** Batch 1 ~24% → Batch 2 ~61% → Batch 3 ~90%. As data quality improves, the evaluator generates more false positives (confirming correct values, reading raw_text instead of parsed names). The evaluator prompt could be improved, but the main parsing prompt is what matters.
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed — prompt is stable for 2 consecutive batches)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The batch-parse script needs 2-3 runs per batch due to BOOT_ERROR (503) from edge function concurrency limits and Anthropic 429 rate limits. Wait ~60s between retries.
  - Biryani has 30 ingredients — the most complex recipe parsed so far. Only 2 true issues out of 30 ingredients = 93% accuracy even for complex recipes.
  - The evaluator increasingly flags false positives as data quality improves. Consider improving the evaluator system prompt before the full re-parse (US-011) to reduce noise.
  - "Crispy onion" is a garnish/topping ingredient listed as a sub-recipe component — these edge cases are hard for the AI to handle perfectly.
  - The prompt is stable: no new issue types in batch 3 vs batch 2. Category_inconsistency dropped to 0 in batch 3 (was 3 in batch 2, 13 in batch 1).
---

## 2026-02-15 - US-007: Parse batch 4 (recipes 61-80), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Batch 4 parsing:** All 20 recipes (offset=60, limit=20) successfully parsed. Required 3 runs: first run parsed 12 (8 BOOT_ERROR 503), second run hit Anthropic 429 rate limit on all 8 remaining, third run (after 65s wait) completed remaining 8.
- **DB state after batch 4:** 83 recipes, 1059 ingredients total.
- **Evaluation results (all 83 recipes, 1059 ingredients):** 85 raw issues
  - pluralization: 18, count_unit_in_name: 15, quantity_precision: 15, category_inconsistency: 15, prep_adjective: 12, non_standard_unit: 9, typo: 1
  - Note: Batch 2/6 of evaluation had JSON parse failure (0 issues captured) — some issues may be underreported from that batch.
- **Batch 4 analysis (20 raw issues → 1 true issue, 19 false positives = 95% FP rate):**
  - TRUE: `black pepper` in Waldorf Salad (quantity_precision — qty=0.125 should be 0.13, 3 decimal places)
  - FALSE POSITIVES breakdown:
    - 5× quantity_precision: raw_text shows excessive decimals (0.33333334326744) but actual qty field correctly rounded to 0.33 — evaluator confused by raw_text vs parsed quantity
    - 5× pluralization: names already singular (grape, blueberry, rib, pork chop, shrimp) — evaluator confirming correct values
    - 4× prep_adjective: names don't contain prep adjectives (walnut, garlic, butter) — evaluator reading raw_text instead of name field
    - 2× count_unit_in_name: units already in unit field (garlic unit=clove, French bread unit=slice) — already correct
    - 1× category_inconsistency: fresh thyme correctly categorized as produce — evaluator uncertain about fresh vs dried
    - 1× quantity_precision: evaluator says "already correct" (0.33)
    - 1× quantity_precision: 0.125 is the only actual issue (see TRUE above)
- **Batch comparison (true issues only):**
  - Batch 1 (parsed with OLD prompt): ~20 true issues
  - Batch 2 (parsed with US-003 prompt): 7 true issues
  - Batch 3 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 3 true issues
  - Batch 4 (parsed with US-004 prompt): **1 true issue** — prompt quality continues to improve
- **Prompt fix decision: No changes needed.** The single true issue (0.125 precision) is already covered by the existing prompt rule "Round to 2 decimal places maximum." This is an AI execution error on one ingredient, not a systemic prompt failure. The prompt is stable for **3 consecutive batches** (batches 2, 3, 4) with no new issue types.
- **Key data quality observations:**
  - Batch 4 recipes are mostly American comfort food and grilling recipes — simpler ingredient lists
  - The AI correctly handles: softened butter (removes prep), chopped walnuts (removes prep), fresh thyme (categorizes as produce), 1/3 fractions (rounds to 0.33)
  - The raw_text field preserves original recipe text including excessive decimals from fraction conversion — this is intentional and correct
  - The evaluator's FP rate continues to climb as data improves: 24% → 61% → 90% → 95%
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed — prompt stable for 3+ batches)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The evaluator's false positive rate is now 95% for batch 4 data. The Claude evaluator system prompt should be improved to differentiate between the `name` field and `raw_text` field — many FPs come from the evaluator reading prep adjectives and excessive decimals from raw_text that are correctly handled in the parsed fields.
  - The 0.125 quantity issue suggests the AI sometimes returns exact fraction conversions (1/8 = 0.125) instead of rounding. This is a minor edge case — 0.125 is mathematically correct but violates the 2-decimal-place rule.
  - Batch-parse BOOT_ERROR (503) and rate limit (429) are expected — 3 runs per batch is the typical pattern. Wait ~60s between retries for rate limits.
  - At 83 recipes and 1059 ingredients, the evaluator takes 6 batches of 15 recipes with ~1.5s delay between — total evaluation time is reasonable.

## 2026-02-16 - US-008: Parse batch 5 (recipes 81-100), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Batch 5 parsing:** All 20 recipes (offset=80, limit=20) successfully parsed. Required 3 runs: first run parsed 9 (11 BOOT_ERROR 503), second run hit Anthropic 429 rate limit on all 11 remaining, third run (after 65s wait) completed all 11.
- **DB state after batch 5:** 103 recipes, 1363 ingredients total.
- **Batch 5 recipes:** Lentil Soup, Lamb Kebabs, Hummus, Falafel, Shakshuka, Baba Ganoush, Tabbouleh Wrap, Chicken Shawarma, Pho, Greek Salad, Moussaka, Spanakopita, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Fattoush, Asian Sesame Salad, Scones, Chimichurri Steak, Jerk Chicken, Beef Recipe Link, Long-Cooked Broccoli
- **Evaluation results (all 103 recipes, 1363 ingredients):** 105 raw issues
  - quantity_precision: 27, category_inconsistency: 20, pluralization: 19, prep_adjective: 17, count_unit_in_name: 13, non_standard_unit: 7, typo: 2
  - Note: Batch 1/7 of evaluation had JSON parse failure after rate limit retry (0 issues captured from first 15 recipes) — some issues may be underreported from early batches.
- **Batch 5 analysis (19 raw issues → 2 true issues, 17 false positives = 89% FP rate):**
  - TRUE: `frozen chopped spinach` in Spanakopita (prep_adjective — "chopped" should be removed, leaving "frozen spinach")
  - TRUE: `tomato paste` in Shakshuka (category_inconsistency — should be "pantry" not "condiments")
  - FALSE POSITIVES breakdown:
    - 8× pluralization: names already singular in DB (pita, radish, eggplant, scallion, bean sprout, pine nut, chickpea, chocolate chip) — evaluator confirming correct values or wrongly suggesting plurals
    - 3× quantity_precision: quantities already ≤2 decimal places (0.33, 0.67, 5.5) — evaluator incorrectly flagging
    - 3× prep_adjective: names already clean in DB (spinach, onion) — evaluator reading raw_text instead of name field
    - 2× count_unit_in_name: garlic already has unit=clove correctly — evaluator confirming correct values
    - 1× non_standard_unit: tabbouleh/Mediterranean salad as sub-recipe components with unit=null — correctly handled per prompt rules
- **Batch comparison (true issues only):**
  - Batch 1 (parsed with OLD prompt): ~20 true issues
  - Batch 2 (parsed with US-003 prompt): 7 true issues
  - Batch 3 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 3 true issues
  - Batch 4 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 1 true issue
  - Batch 5 (parsed with US-004 prompt): **2 true issues** — prompt quality remains excellent
- **Prompt fix decision: No changes needed.** Both true issues are from existing issue types already covered by current prompt rules:
  - "frozen chopped spinach" — prompt already says to remove prep adjectives; AI kept "chopped" alongside product-form qualifier "frozen"
  - "tomato paste" categorized as "condiments" — prompt already says canned tomato products → pantry; AI miscategorized this specific one
  - These are AI execution edge cases (2 out of ~300 new ingredients = 99.3% accuracy), not systemic prompt failures
- **No new issue types found.** Prompt is stable for **4 consecutive batches** (batches 2, 3, 4, 5) with no new issue types.
- **Notable batch 5 observations:**
  - Middle Eastern/Mediterranean recipes dominate this batch (Lentil Soup, Lamb Kebabs, Hummus, Falafel, Shakshuka, Baba Ganoush, Tabbouleh, Chicken Shawarma, Fattoush, Spanakopita, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Greek Salad, Moussaka)
  - Pho has 25 ingredients — complex Vietnamese recipe handled well (0 true issues in batch 5 analysis)
  - Sub-recipe references (tabbouleh in Falafel, Mediterranean salad in Chicken Shawarma) correctly handled with unit=null, cat=other
  - Evaluator FP rate trend: 24% → 61% → 90% → 95% → 89% (stabilizing around 89-95%)
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed — prompt stable for 4+ batches)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Batch-parse continues to require 3 runs per batch — BOOT_ERROR (503) from edge function concurrency, then Anthropic 429 rate limits. The 65-second wait between retries is sufficient.
  - At 103 recipes and 1363 ingredients, the evaluator uses 7 batches of 15 recipes. Evaluation takes ~2 minutes including rate limit waits.
  - The evaluator's JSON parsing occasionally fails on rate-limited retries (batch 1/7 returned 0 issues due to truncated JSON response). This doesn't affect the batch 5 analysis since those recipes are in later evaluation batches.
  - Middle Eastern cuisine ingredients are handled well by the prompt — spices (sumac, Aleppo pepper, za'atar), specialty items (grape leaves in brine, phyllo dough, tahini), and fresh herbs all categorized correctly.

## 2026-02-16 - US-009: Parse batch 6 (recipes 101-120), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Batch 6 parsing:** All 20 recipes (offset=100, limit=20) successfully parsed. Required 3 runs: first run parsed 11 (8 BOOT_ERROR 503, 1 already parsed from prior session), second run hit Anthropic 429 rate limit on all 8 remaining, third run (after 65s wait) completed all 8.
- **Notable:** "Double Tofu Caesar Sandwich" returned 0 ingredients — its URL is an Instagram Reel (`instagram.com/reels/`) which the edge function cannot parse for recipe data. This is expected; the recipe will have no ingredients in the DB.
- **DB state after batch 6:** 122 recipes, 1581 ingredients total.
- **Batch 6 recipes:** Fried Artichokes with Lemony Garlic Aioli, Macaroni and Cheese, Vegan Crab Cakes, Cheesy Hasselback Potato Gratin, Atlantic Beach Pie, Manicotti with Cheese Filling and Bolognese Sauce, Cornmeal Fritters, Gobi 65, Beer-Battered Fish with Malt Vinegar Aioli, Artichoke Soup with Pesto, Rice Noodles with Garlicky Cashew Sauce, Double Tofu Caesar Sandwich, Beer Bread, Coconut Rice, Cantonese Soy Sauce Pan-Fried Noodles, Chicken Satay, Chocolate Guinness Cake, Yellow Chicken Adobo, Sticky and Spicy Baked Cauliflower, Split Pea Soup
- **Evaluation results (all 122 recipes, 1581 ingredients):** 104 raw issues
  - category_inconsistency: 30, count_unit_in_name: 23, quantity_precision: 16, non_standard_unit: 13, prep_adjective: 11, pluralization: 9, typo: 2
  - Note: Batch 2/9 of evaluation had JSON parse failure (0 issues captured from that batch) — some issues may be underreported.
- **Batch 6 analysis (13 raw issues → 1 true issue, 12 false positives = 92% FP rate):**
  - TRUE: `saltine cracker` in Atlantic Beach Pie (non_standard_unit — unit="sleeve" is not a standard unit; should be converted to oz/piece/null)
  - FALSE POSITIVES breakdown:
    - 5× count_unit_in_name: units already correctly in unit field (garlic unit=clove, lemongrass unit=stalk, bacon unit=slice, thyme unit=sprig, cauliflower unit=head) — evaluator confirming correct values
    - 3× category_inconsistency: chickpea and artichoke heart already correctly "pantry"; evaluator flagged vanilla extract as "pantry" but "spices" is reasonable for a flavoring extract
    - 2× pluralization: "baby artichoke heart" is the product name (frozen baby artichoke hearts), cauliflower already clean
    - 1× typo: turmeric already correctly spelled in name field (raw_text has "tumeric" but name is correct)
    - 1× non_standard_unit: lemon with unit=piece is valid
- **Batch comparison (true issues only):**
  - Batch 1 (parsed with OLD prompt): ~20 true issues
  - Batch 2 (parsed with US-003 prompt): 7 true issues
  - Batch 3 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 3 true issues
  - Batch 4 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 1 true issue
  - Batch 5 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 2 true issues
  - Batch 6 (parsed with US-004 prompt): **1 true issue** — prompt quality remains excellent
- **Prompt fix decision: No changes needed.** The single true issue ("sleeve" unit) is an uncommon measurement unit that the AI encountered for the first time. The prompt already has rules for non-standard units — this is an AI execution edge case, not a systemic prompt failure. No new issue types found. Prompt is stable for **5 consecutive batches** (batches 2-6) with no new issue types.
- **Evaluator FP rate trend:** 24% → 61% → 90% → 95% → 89% → 92% (stabilizing around 89-95%)
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed — prompt stable for 5+ batches)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Instagram Reel URLs cannot be parsed for recipe data — the edge function's URL fetcher doesn't extract structured recipe content from Instagram. "Double Tofu Caesar Sandwich" has 0 ingredients as a result. This is expected and doesn't count as a failure.
  - "Sleeve" as a unit for crackers is a real measurement (a sleeve of saltine crackers ≈ 40 crackers) but it's not in the standard unit list. The AI should have converted it.
  - Vanilla extract category (spices vs pantry) is genuinely ambiguous — "spices" is defensible since it's shelved in the spice section of most stores, though "pantry" would also be valid. No need to add a specific rule.
  - At 122 recipes and 1581 ingredients, the evaluator uses 9 batches of 15 recipes. One batch had a JSON parse failure but this doesn't affect the batch-6-specific analysis.

## 2026-02-16 - US-010: Parse final batch (recipes 121-153), evaluate, and fix if needed
- **Final batch parsing:** 33 recipes attempted (offset=120, limit=33). 28 parsed successfully across 5 runs. 5 recipes have persistent URL failures — not transient, these are broken/blocked URLs.
- **5 permanently failing recipes:**
  1. **Hetty McKinnon's Flourless Soy Sauce Brownies** — 404 (page removed/URL broken)
  2. **Roasted Fennel Pasta** — 429 (food52.com persistently rate-limiting)
  3. **Crunchy Creamy Cucumber Avocado Salad** — 429 (persistently rate-limited)
  4. **Skirt Steak with Jammy Shallots** — 403 (site blocking scraping)
  5. **Whole Lemon Salad** — 400 (Anthropic API "Could not process image" — page contains unparseable image content)
- **DB state after final batch:** 154 recipes (153 from recipes.ts + 1 pre-existing), 1898 ingredients total. 149 recipe_content entries with status=completed, 5 stuck in status=parsing (the failed URLs).
- **Recipes with 0 ingredients (6 total):** 5 URL failures above + "Double Tofu Caesar Sandwich" (Instagram Reel from batch 6). 148 recipes have ingredients.
- **Evaluation results (all 154 recipes, 1898 ingredients):** 111 raw issues (note: 3 evaluator batches had JSON parse failures from rate limits, so ~45 recipes' issues are missing from the count)
  - count_unit_in_name: 33
  - category_inconsistency: 25
  - quantity_precision: 16
  - pluralization: 13
  - prep_adjective: 12
  - non_standard_unit: 10
  - typo: 2
- **Final batch (batch 7) analysis (14 raw issues → ~4 true issues, ~10 false positives = 71% FP rate):**
  - TRUE: `rock salt` in Pommes Dauphine (non_standard_unit — "pinch" not standard)
  - TRUE: `coconut milk` in Coconut Creamed Kale (category_inconsistency — should be "pantry" not "dairy")
  - TRUE: `ginger` in Coconut Creamed Kale (non_standard_unit — "inch" not standard)
  - TRUE: `sliced almond` in Trout Amandine (prep_adjective — "sliced" should be removed)
  - FALSE POSITIVES: 2× pluralization (already singular), 2× category (already correct), 4× count_unit_in_name (already correct or ingredient name, not unit), 1× prep_adjective (only in raw_text), 1× count_unit_in_name (correct as-is)
- **Batch comparison (true issues only, across all batches):**
  - Batch 1 (parsed with OLD prompt): ~20 true issues
  - Batch 2 (parsed with US-003 prompt): 7 true issues
  - Batch 3 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 3 true issues
  - Batch 4 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 1 true issue
  - Batch 5 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 2 true issues
  - Batch 6 (parsed with US-004 prompt): 1 true issue
  - Batch 7/final (parsed with US-004 prompt): **~4 true issues** — all existing issue types
- **Overall initial-pass statistics across all 153 recipes:**
  - 148 recipes parsed with ingredients, 6 with 0 ingredients (5 broken URLs + 1 Instagram Reel)
  - 1898 total ingredients parsed
  - 111 raw evaluator issues (with 3 batches missing due to evaluator fetch errors)
  - Estimated ~30-40 true issues across all 153 recipes, rest are evaluator false positives
  - Most true issues come from batches 1-2 (parsed with earlier prompts before fixes). The full re-parse (US-011) will fix these.
  - No new issue types found in any batch since batch 2
  - Prompt has been stable for **6 consecutive batches** (batches 2-7)
- **Prompt fix decision: No changes needed.** All batch 7 true issues are from existing issue types already covered by current prompt rules. These are AI execution edge cases, not systemic prompt failures.
- **Files changed:** None (no prompt changes needed — prompt stable for 6+ batches)
- **Verification:**
  - Edge function tests pass (30/30): `npx vitest run tests/unit/edge-functions/parse-recipe.test.ts`
  - `npm run build` passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - 5 of 153 recipes have permanently broken/blocked URLs — these will have 0 ingredients in the DB and recipes.ts. This is expected and acceptable.
  - The food52.com website is particularly aggressive with rate limiting (429 errors persist even after 2+ minute waits)
  - Some recipe pages contain images that Anthropic's API cannot process (400 "Could not process image" error)
  - The evaluator's fetch errors (3 out of 10 batches) mean the 111 issue count is an undercount — actual total is likely 140-160 raw issues, with ~40-50 true issues
  - The vast majority of true issues (~80%) come from batches 1-2 which were parsed with earlier, less-refined prompts
  - For the full re-parse (US-011), the 5 broken URLs will still fail — consider marking them as "unparseable" in the DB or skipping them
